# test_framework
It's a project for test tasks. For launching tests you should have installed java 8 or later,  IntellJ Idea, Macor Windows OS and the latest version of Chrome
You can clone the project via git clone command: git clone https://github.com/QL-Anton/test_framework.git. 
Directory with path https://github.com/QL-Anton/test_framework/tree/master/test-task/src/test/java contains  automated tests for CafeTown test application. 

For implementing test cases I choosed Java as programming languge, Selenium as framefork for interacting with the browser and TestNG as test framework. 

Test cases were created using base test design tecnique: State-Transition Testing, Decision Table Testing etc. Some of test cases were automated and presented in this project.
